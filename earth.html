<h1>Earth</h1>
<img src = "earth.jpg">
<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the
only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of
Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust.
The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the
form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. </p>
