<h1>Mars</h1>
<img src = "mars.jpg">
<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orangered because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the
Red Planet". Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and its highcontrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing. It
is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar
System's planets.</p>
