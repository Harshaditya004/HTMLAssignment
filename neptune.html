<h1>Neptune</h1>
<img src = "neptune.jpg">
<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is
the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive
planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth. Compared
to its fellow ice giant Uranus, Neptune is slightly more massive, but denser and
smaller. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined
solid surface.</p>
