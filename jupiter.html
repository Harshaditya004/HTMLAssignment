<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other
planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the
mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth, and a tenth that of
the Sun.</p>
