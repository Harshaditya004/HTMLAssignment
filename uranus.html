<h1>Uranus</h1>
<img src = "uranus.jpg">
<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyancoloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in
a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. The
planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest
minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar System's
planets.</p>
